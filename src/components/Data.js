    question: "How many photos do we get?",
    answer:
      "You get a crap ton. Probably an overwhelming amount. While there is no set number I deliver because every wedding is so completely different, I have never had any client say they didnt get enough.",

    question: "How do we get our photos",

You and the fam can also order ridiculously good lookin products off the site such as prints, wedding albums, etc. Cool stuff to make sure your photos dont die on a hard drive..",

    question: "Do you retouch the photos?",
    answer:
      "My goal for the image retouching is to tone the colors to make them timeless and not dated to a certain timeframe/trend. I try and emulate the beauty of film in my digital images. I wont do any body transforming as I dont believe in that but if youve got some sort of blemish or small mark that you would like me to remove in images, I got you!",
