      <h1>HI! I am Syahruz.</h1>
      <p>
        ...and I'm in this for you. I live a simple life in the sunny Singapore.
        Iâ€™m a rock climber, grumpy cat fan, and I feel pretty weird talking
        about myself. <br/><br/>I've been shooting weddings for 10 years and have found
        that I enjoy being truly intentional about how I shoot. It's about the
        experience, and the way a photo can bring you back, like the scent of
        nostalgia. <br/><br/>
        To be honest, I'm not the best with words, but I believe my photos
        say it all. 
      </p>
    </div>
